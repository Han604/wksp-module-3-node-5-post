# Exercise 1

Create a todo list! (You must have seen this coming.)

**Do NOT look at yesterday's workshop to complete this.**

## Guidelines

- create an endpoint called `/todos` to render your todo app.
- create an endpoint called `/data` to receive the data from the form `post` request.

## Extras

Once you have completed Exercise 2, you can come back here and add more features.

- multiple lists?
- a `done` button that crosses out the item.
- a `delete` that deletes the item.

o //create an array object 
//create a post form that receives data in a req.body stringify the input
//create separate page handlers todosHandler, dataHandler
//on the todos page we need a forEach on the array to display on refresh the list items
//submit on the form must redirect to /todos
